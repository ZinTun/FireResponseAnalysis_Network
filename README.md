# FireResponseAnalysis_Network
This paper studies the causal effect of a new road construction on the emergency response time of response units in Boulder, CO, USA using network data. An egocentric network was created with fire station and incident locations as nodes and each incident as an edge between the locations. Network features (degree, closeness), and incident specific features (emergency, distance, etc) were included in the difference-in-difference analysis. Results of the analysis shows that the construction of the underpass resulted in significant increase in response time of 32s during the construction and a significant decrease in response time of 41s after the construction is completed. It can be concluded that introducing new routes, be it for vehicles or pedestrians, could have a positive impact on response times due to improved connectivity and reduction in road congestion. It is recommended that cities that want to improve emergency response time can do so by introducing new routes in the city.
